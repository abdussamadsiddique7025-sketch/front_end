# WellCare Frontend (Full)

This is an expanded React frontend with:
- Mock authentication (localStorage) and token simulation
- Patient and Provider dashboards
- Profile editing
- Goal logging

To run:
1. unzip
2. npm install
3. npm start

Notes:
- This uses a mock API in src/api.js that stores data in localStorage.
- Replace src/api.js with real axios calls to your backend when available.
